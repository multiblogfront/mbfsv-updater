# These are shell commands that might be used _by_ this package
# to retrieve necessary information. This package is _not_ used
# in their implementation - but their presence is relied upon
# by this package:

git rev-parse HEAD
# This retrieves the current _local_ revision-ID of the GIT
# package that we are on. This information is needed in order
# to "bless" a Special Version - and may be needed for other
# purposes as well.

git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD
# This retrieves the branch ID that the local repository is
# on. It is needed so that any upgrading that goes on can be
# kept on-branch.

git remote get-url origin
# This identifies the URL of the 'origin' remote repo.
